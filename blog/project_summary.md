## üîß Technical Highlights

### Architecture Decisions

**Why MobileNet?**
- Lightweight, runs in browser
- Pre-trained on ImageNet
- Good for educational demos
- TensorFlow.js support

**Why Simplified Text Encoding?**
- Full transformer too complex for browser
- Keyword-based approach teaches concepts
- Easy to understand and modify
- Good enough for demonstrations

**Why No True CLIP?**
- CLIP models are 400MB+
- Requires more compute than browser can handle
- Simplified version teaches same concepts
- Focus on understanding, not state-of-art

### Performance Optimizations

- TensorFlow.js for GPU acceleration
- Efficient canvas operations
- D3.js for smooth visualizations
- No unnecessary re-renders
- Proper cleanup with tf.tidy()

### Browser Compatibility

‚úÖ Chrome (recommended)  
‚úÖ Firefox  
‚úÖ Safari  
‚úÖ Edge  
‚ö†Ô∏è IE not supported (uses modern JavaScript)
