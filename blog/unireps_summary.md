### Title
**"Universal Representations in Multimodal Learning: Why Different Models Converge on Similar Image-Text Embeddings"**

### Abstract (150 words)
A fascinating phenomenon emerges when training multimodal models: despite differences in architecture, training data, and optimization procedures, models like CLIP, ALIGN, and BLIP learn strikingly similar internal representations. We explore when, how, and why this convergence occurs, drawing connections between machine learning, neuroscience, and information theory. Through interactive visualizations and cross-model comparisons, we demonstrate that representational similarity can be quantified using metrics like CKA and RSA, revealing high convergence (>0.8) even across architectural families. We present theoretical perspectives including the data manifold hypothesis, optimization landscape analysis, and information bottleneck theory. Parallels with neuroscience—where different brains develop similar visual processing hierarchies—suggest universal principles of learning. Finally, we showcase practical applications: model stitching, weight merging, and zero-shot transfer, enabled by representational convergence. This work provides both an interactive educational tool and a foundation for understanding universal representations in multimodal AI.
