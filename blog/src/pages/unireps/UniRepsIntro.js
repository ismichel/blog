          <h4 className="display-8">A Surprising Discovery</h4>
          When researchers trained different multimodal models—CLIP (OpenAI), ALIGN (Google), BLIP (Salesforce), and others—they discovered something remarkable: <span className="emph">despite using different architectures, training on different datasets, and optimizing with different procedures, these models learned strikingly similar internal representations</span>.
          <br /><br />
          Images of dogs ended up in similar regions of embedding space. The text "a cat" pointed to similar locations. The relationships between concepts—that "puppy" is close to "dog", that "vehicle" relates to "car"—emerged consistently across models.
          <br /><br />

          <h4 className="display-8">Why Does This Matter?</h4>
          This convergence suggests something fundamental about how neural networks learn from visual-linguistic data:
          <div style={{backgroundColor: "#e8f4f8", padding: 20, borderRadius: 8, marginTop: 15, marginBottom: 15}}>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Data Structure Hypothesis</strong>: The representations reflect the inherent structure of the data itself, not arbitrary choices in model design</li>
              <li><strong>Optimization Landscape</strong>: Different optimization paths (SGD, Adam, etc.) lead to the same local minima in representation space</li>
              <li><strong>Inductive Biases</strong>: Despite architectural differences, common constraints (convolution, attention) guide learning toward similar solutions</li>
              <li><strong>Task Demands</strong>: The contrastive learning objective forces models to discover the same semantic structure</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h4 className="display-8">Parallels with Neuroscience</h4>
          This phenomenon mirrors discoveries in neuroscience. Different biological brains—whether across individuals or even across species—develop similar representations for processing visual information:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>V1 Simple Cells</strong>: Edge detectors emerge in primate visual cortex, remarkably similar to first-layer CNN filters</li>
            <li><strong>Hierarchical Organization</strong>: Both brains and CNNs process information hierarchically: edges → textures → parts → objects</li>
            <li><strong>Invariances</strong>: Both learn similar invariances (to position, rotation, scale)</li>
            <li><strong>Semantic Organization</strong>: Concept clustering in human semantic memory resembles embedding space organization</li>
          </ul>

          <div style={{backgroundColor: "#fff3cd", padding: 20, borderRadius: 8, marginTop: 20}}>
            <strong>The Central Question:</strong> If different learning systems (biological brains, various neural architectures) converge on similar representations, what does this tell us about the fundamental nature of visual and linguistic understanding?
          </div>

          <h4 className="display-8">Practical Implications</h4>
          Understanding representational convergence has immediate practical benefits:
          <br /><br />
          <strong>1. Model Stitching & Merging</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>If models learn similar representations, we can swap components between them</li>
            <li>Use CLIP's image encoder with ALIGN's text encoder</li>
            <li>Merge weights from multiple models to improve performance</li>
          </ul>

          <strong>2. Transfer Learning & Zero-Shot Generalization</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Representations learned by one model transfer to others</li>
            <li>Fine-tune on one model's outputs, deploy on another</li>
            <li>Cross-model knowledge distillation</li>
          </ul>

          <strong>3. Model Efficiency</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>If convergence is guaranteed, focus on computational efficiency</li>
            <li>Smaller models can learn similar representations to larger ones</li>
            <li>Knowledge about universal features guides architecture design</li>
          </ul>

          <strong>4. Interpretability</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Universal features are more likely to be meaningful</li>
            <li>Consistent representations across models build trust</li>
            <li>Easier to explain what models have learned</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 className="display-8">Our Exploration</h4>
          In this module, we'll investigate:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>How</strong> to measure similarity between representations from different models</li>
            <li><strong>Why</strong> convergence happens (theoretical perspectives)</li>
            <li><strong>When</strong> convergence occurs (and when it doesn't)</li>
            <li><strong>What</strong> practical applications benefit from this understanding</li>
          </ol>
          
          Through interactive visualizations and comparisons, you'll see firsthand how different architectures arrive at similar solutions to the multimodal learning problem.
